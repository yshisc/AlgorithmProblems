 * 26.Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array
 *
 * Keep two pointers:
 * (1)p1 points to first position that has not been added to valid subarray, which is also the position ready to be assign as j's value.
 * (2)p2 moves to find first number that is not equal to (p1-2)'s number
 * Increment p1, and assign p2's number to p1's position, increment p2.
 * Finally p1 is the last position of new array.
