 * 72.Edit Distance
 *
 * Solution:
 *      State: f[i][j]: minimum number of steps of converting (first i of word1) to (first j of word2)
 *
 *      Function:
 *          1.xxxx(a)  yyyyy(b)     If word1[i-1] != word[j-1]
 *              (1)Insert b, to make (first i of word1) same as (first j-1 of word2), number is f[i][j-1] + 1
 *                                         xxxxa                      yyyy
 *              (2)Delete a, to make (first i-1 of word1) same as (first j of word2), number is f[i-1][j] + 1
 *                                         xxxx                       yyyya
 *              (3)Replace a with b, to make (first i-1 of word1) same as (first j-1 of word2), number is f[i-1][j-1] + 1
 *                                         xxxx                       yyyy
 *          2.xxxx(a)  yyyy(a)     If word1[i-1] == word[j-1]
 *              The only difference with 1 is in (3) that we do not need to replace, number is f[i-1][j-1]
 *
 *          So, f[i][j] = min(f[i][j-1]+1, f[i-1][j]+1, f[i-1][j-1])     word1[i-1] == word[j-1]
 *              f[i][j] = min(f[i][j-1]+1, f[i-1][j]+1, f[i-1][j-1]+1)   word1[i-1] != word[j-1]
 *
 *      Initialize: f[i][0] = i  converting first i of word1 to empty, we need delete i times
 *                  f[0][j] = j  converting empty to first j of word2, we need insert j times
 *
 *      Answer: f[n1][n2]
